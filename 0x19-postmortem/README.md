# SocialButterfly Outage Report

On May 6th, it was reported that the SocialButterfly platform was experiencing intermittent outages, resulting in users being unable to access the platform. The root cause was identified as a failure of our database server.

# Timeline
The issue first appeared at 2:00 PM EST on May 6th, when our monitoring system alerted us to an unusually high number of database queries. Our Site Reliability Engineer, Ms. Hernandez, immediately investigated and discovered that the database server was overloaded and was unable to handle the incoming requests.

At 3:30 PM EST, our engineers made the decision to temporarily disable the database server to prevent further damage to the system. We then redirected all traffic to a backup database server, but this caused a temporary outage for all users while the backup server was brought online.

By 6:00 PM EST, we had restored full service to all users by replicating the data from the backup server to the main database server and re-enabling it.

# Root cause and resolution
The SocialButterfly platform is powered by a single database server that handles all incoming requests. The root cause of the outage was a surge in traffic, which overloaded the database server and caused it to fail.

To prevent this from happening in the future, we have implemented several measures. First, we have optimized the database server to handle a larger number of requests by improving indexing and query efficiency. Second, we have implemented a load balancer to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple database servers. Third, we have added additional servers to our system to provide redundancy in case of future outages.

# Measures against such problem in future
Regularly monitor system performance to detect issues before they escalate
Implement load balancing and redundancy measures to prevent a single point of failure
Perform regular maintenance on servers and databases to ensure optimal performance"
